  # With vcflib 1.0.3, we now suddenly get:
  # vcfcat: error while loading shared libraries: libtabixpp.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  # So let's try a newer version...
  # Nope, also does not work, see https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/issues/389,
  # and 1.0.9 is not available on MacOS yet...
  # Trying again with 1.0.3, but also specify freebayes, to see if that helps...
