# The dedup documentation says that -o is an output file, but the program then complains
# that it needs a directory instead... and then litters the output directory with all kinds
# of files that we do not want. So, let's use a shadow directory, and let's pray that the file naming
# of the `*rmdup.bam` file is consistent (hard to tell, as this is not documented in dedup)...
# --> Update: Not using a shadow diretory any more, still seems to work fine.
# Furthermore, dedup does not sort, so we have to do this ourselves (Again! We already sorted
# after mapping... How does that program mess up the existing order?!).
# Luckily, this combination of unfortunate usages (weird output files, and additional need to sort)
# can be leveraged here by declaring the unsorted, weirdly named dedup output file as a temp file,
# and then feed that into samtools for sorting, after which the dedup file will be deleted again.
# At least a little bit of comfort!
# Lastly, we also keep the json file for reporting with multiqc.
