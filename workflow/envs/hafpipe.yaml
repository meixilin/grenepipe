  - unzip

  # We need samtools for indexing bam files.
  # Also, tabix and bgzip are dependencies of hafpipe,
  # which both seem to be provided via samtools as well.
  - samtools ==1.20
  # - htslib ==1.16
  # - tabix ==1.10

  # hafpipe needs R version >= 3.2, so we use the same that
  # we also use in the gatk.yaml, for simplicity.
  # See also https://github.com/petrov-lab/HAFpipe-line/issues/3
  # Update: this is currently not longer needed with our updated version.
  # - r 3.5.1 #==4.1
  # - r-data.table

  # We use our new python script for making the numeric snp table,
  # and need numpy for the npute scripts.
  - python ==3.12
  - pandas ==2.2.2
  - numpy  ==2.0.0

  # We first tried to build harp on our own, which did not work,
  # due to boost paths not being found when using conda to install it,
  # and because the harp source does not use C++ namespaces correctly...
  # So now we just use the precompiled harp binaries,
  # but below keep our trials, for later reference if ever needed.
  #
  # harp also wants boost. Somehow, 1.73.0, which seems to be
  # the latest on conda, does not work with mamba, but it pulls 1.77.0,
  # which does not work. So let's try 1.67.0 instead...
  # - boost ==1.77.0
  # - gcc ==8.5.0
  # - gxx_linux-64 ==7.3.0
